BMI Calculator: A Practical Project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I present to you my BMI calculator, a project developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This online tool allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) quickly and easily, providing important information about their health and well-being.

Through a friendly and intuitive interface, the calculator asks the user for their height and weight. Based on this data, the JavaScript script calculates the BMI and displays the result on the screen, classifying it according to the ideal weight range, overweight or obesity.

The project demonstrates mastery of the main web technologies, combining the basic structure of HTML with the stylization of CSS and the interactivity provided by JavaScript. The BMI calculator is a practical example of the application of these languages, offering a useful tool for the general public.
